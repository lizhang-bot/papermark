/**
 * SQL builders for bulk-saving dataroom permissions.
 *
 * Replaces per-row `prisma.*.upsert(...)` loops inside
 * `prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => …)` blocks, which needed thousands of
 * round-trips on large datarooms and reliably timed out Prisma's interactive
 * transaction window for big "Save changes" payloads.
 *
 * Two consumers share these builders:
 *   1. **Viewer groups** (admin-side dataroom permissions UI) — writes to
 *      `ViewerGroupAccessControls`. Append-only delta semantics: only rows
 *      in the user's payload are upserted; nothing is deleted.
 *   2. **Link permission groups** (per-link permission overrides) — writes
 *      to `PermissionGroupAccessControls`. Set-everything semantics: the
 *      caller posts the complete desired state, so any DB row not in the
 *      payload (or in the computed ancestor set) is deleted.
 *
 * Both tables share the columns we touch:
 *   `id, groupId, itemId, itemType, canView, canDownload, createdAt, updatedAt`
 *
 * `PermissionGroupAccessControls` has an extra `canDownloadOriginal Boolean
 * @default(false)`. We intentionally never reference it in the SET clause
 * here so its existing value is preserved on update and the column default
 * fills in for INSERT — same shape as the previous Prisma client code path.
 *
 * `id` values are generated client-side as cuids — same convention as the
 * rest of the schema's `@id @default(cuid())` columns — and passed in as
 * normal bound parameters.
 *
 * All builders are pure functions over their inputs so we can assert their
 * shape in unit tests without spinning up Postgres.
 */

/**
 * The two access-control tables we know how to bulk-write to. The literal
 * string is interpolated into the SQL with `Prisma.raw`, which is safe here
 * because the value is a closed union type — it cannot be supplied by user
 * input, only by callers in this codebase.
